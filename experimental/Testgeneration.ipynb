      "Models are expensive to initially train, but once built, their representations are relatively \n",
      "cheap to use and be fine-tuned for different tasks. Thus, many technologists simply \n",
      "use pretrained large language models built by others (usually large companies, with the \n",
      "expertise and resources) instead of paying to create their own. The few big pretrained \n",
      "models that exist have thus become a sort of infrastructure, known as “foundation \n",
      "models” (Bommasani et al., 2021 ). This gives many technologists access to the state of \n",
      "the art capabilities, but it also creates a single point of failure for the sector as a whole: \n",
      "if a foundation model has a problem, it will persist across many applications. And these \n",
      "models are so large and complicated that even when they are open source, researchers \n",
      "cannot understand the underlying logic they use to come up with individual decisions.\n",
      "Many of the largest and most advanced of these foundation models — such as \n",
      "OpenAI’s GPT-4, Google’s PaLM, and Meta’s LLaMa — are trained primarily on \n",
      "English language data. In the next section, we explore one reason why that may be: the \n",

      "capitalism; it has the most total speakers and the third-most first-language speakers \n",
      "(Ethnologue, 2023b ). It is the primary language spoken on the internet, accounting \n",
      "for 63.7% of websites, despite being spoken by only 16% of the world’s population \n",
      "(Richter, n.d. ). This dominance does not stem from any sort of inherent linguistic \n",
      "superiority: rather it is the colonial and neocolonial legacy of nearly three hundred \n",
      "years of the preeminent global superpower speaking English — first Great Britain, \n",
      "then the United States. The British government prioritized the English language \n",
      "through official language policies to facilitate trade and in an attempt to “modernize” \n",
      "its colonies, and as British, and later American trade became globally dominant, so too \n",
      "did English ( Corradi, 2017 ; Phillipson, 1992). Prioritization of the English language \n",
      "came at the expense of other regional and indigenous languages and accelerated \n",
      "language endangerment and economic marginalization, which still impedes digital \n",
      "investment into these languages worldwide ( Rowe, 2022 ; S. Zhang et al., 2022 ). \n",
