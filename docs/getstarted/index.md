Welcome to the Ragas tutorials! If you're new to Ragas, the Get Started guides will walk you through the fundamentals of working with Ragas. These tutorials assume basic knowledge of Python and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. 

Before you proceed further, make sure you have [Ragas installed](./install.md)!

:::{note}
The tutorials only give you an overview of what you can do with Ragas and the basic skills needed to use it. If you want an in-depth explanation of the core concepts behind Ragas, check out the [Core Concepts](../concepts/index.md) page. You can also check out the [How-to Guides](../howtos/index.md) if you want specific applications of Ragas.
