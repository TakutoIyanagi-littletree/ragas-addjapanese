Welcome to the Ragas tutorials! If your news to Ragas the Get Started guides will walk you through the fundamentals of working with Ragas. These tutorials do assume basic
knowledge of Python and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. 

Before you go further make sure you have [Ragas installed](./install.md)!

:::{note}
The tutorials only give you on overview of what you can do with ragas and the basic skill you need to use it. If you want an in-depth explanation of the core-concepts behind Ragas, check out the [Core Concepts](../concepts/index.md) page. You can also checkout the [How-to Guides](../howtos/index.md) if you want to specific applications of Ragas.
